                ðŸ’»ðŸ˜€ I'm Frontend Developer and I'm looking for a job. I thought what I wanted to do in life for a long time. My search led me to the IT industry and I finally felt what I want to do - work as a Frontend Developer. You can see what I have already learned below, what I would like to learn in the near future and my finished projects. Feel free to contact me ðŸ“§
